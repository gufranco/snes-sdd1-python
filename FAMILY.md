# The family standard

These sixteen repositories are one family and are held to one standard. Where
they differ, the difference must be something the hardware forces, not something
nobody got round to.

## The authority ladder

Every factual question is answered by the highest rung that has an answer, and a
lower rung never overrules a higher one.

1. **Manufacturer documentation.** Anything printed decides. Read it in full
   rather than searching it, because the passages that matter are the ones
   nobody quotes.
2. **The part's own program or the artefact itself.** A cartridge, a firmware
   image, a header. What the silicon was actually asked to do.
3. **A recording from an independent implementation**, for behaviour nobody
   documented.
4. **Nothing else.** An emulator, an FPGA core, a wiki and a forum post are rung
   3 at best and rung 4 for anything printed.

A document that contradicts itself is common. When it does, the cycle table and
the pin descriptions have both times been right and the prose wrong.

**Never calibrate against an emulator where a document exists.** A recording is
evidence about behaviour nobody wrote down. It is not evidence about a register
width, a bit name, or anything else a manufacturer printed, however many
implementations agree with it. Where a recording contradicts a document, the
document wins, the disagreement is written down, and the model follows the
document.

**A recording whose answer depends on the machine it was built on is not evidence
at all.** It is a property of the recorder, and it is excluded and named rather
than allowed to decide.

## What every repository carries

| Gate | Standard |
|:--|:--|
| Format | `ruff format --check .`, clean |
| Lint | `ruff check .`, zero findings |
| Types | `mypy` at strict plus every optional error class, zero findings |
| Tests | `<module>.test.py` beside the module, run individually |
| Coverage | 100% statement and branch, enforced, on a machine holding no artefacts |
| JSON | `pnpm run format:check`, with every submodule tree exempted |
| CI | lint, types, tests on 3.12/3.13/3.14, plus the project's own conformance job |
| Schedule | a weekly run against unpinned tools and the newest runtime, starting on ground the pipeline never reaches |
| Analysis | CodeQL and Scorecard |
| Release | semantic-release from `main`, never tagged by hand |
| Docs | README, AGENTS.md plus the one-line pointer each tool reads, CONTRIBUTING, SECURITY, CODE_OF_CONDUCT |
| Review | CODEOWNERS on every path, and templates that ask a report for the run that settles it |
| Specs | `specs/current/`, requirements with checkable scenarios |
| Hardware facts | `conformance/hardware.json`, every fact with the sentence it came from |
| Disagreements | `conformance/divergences.json`, both readings and what would settle it |

## Conventions that are not negotiable

| Thing | Rule |
|:--|:--|
| Language | Python only |
| Comments | None in source, ever. Docstrings carry the reasoning |
| Test structure | Arrange, blank line, one act, blank line, assert. No section labels |
| Nothing starts clean | Memory and registers hold what they held, from a seed |
| Artefacts | Never committed: no ROM, no firmware, no fragment of one |
| Only retail dumps | A ROM hack is somebody's edit, not what hardware ran |
| Package manager | pnpm, never npm |

## What a conformance runner must report

A runner asked about ground it has never been held to has three options and two
of them are lies. Reporting agreement lies about the part. Skipping in silence
lies about the run, because the summary then counts a comparison that never
happened. The third is to refuse: name what was compared, name what was not and
why, and count the two apart.

Report per part, never one number over parts with different evidence. One part
held to its manufacturer's manual and another held to nothing are not one figure.

## The state of this repository
## The state of this repository

**The top rung of the ladder is empty for this part.** Neither Ricoh nor
Nintendo published a datasheet for the S-DD1, and nothing suggests one exists.
Everything anybody knows about the algorithm was reconstructed from the silicon
or from its output. So every constant in
[`conformance/hardware.json`](conformance/hardware.json) carries `verified:
false`, and that is a statement about the sources rather than about the values.

**Every expected output comes from an emulator.** There is no other source: the
chip's output for a given input cannot be derived from anything on this machine.
Agreement with either conformance file therefore means agreement with snes9x, and
where snes9x is wrong this decoder is wrong with it.

**The shape census is not from retail cartridges, whatever its comment says.**
[`conformance/extract.py`](conformance/extract.py) finds a stream by searching for
a four byte tag. Measured on 2026-08-21 across a library of 7,578 images: the four
retail cartridges carrying this chip contain that tag zero times. The only builds
that carry it are two modified Virtual Console re-releases, and they yield 5,630
streams spread evenly across all sixteen shapes, where the shipped census records
11,306 with 2,815 in a single shape. Neither figure can be reproduced from
anything in that library, and 2,815 streams sharing one shape is what coincidental
byte matches look like rather than what a game's data looks like.

That does not make the decoder wrong. It makes the claim that this decoder has
been exercised against the shapes hardware actually drives unsupported, and the
random vectors reach all sixteen shapes regardless. It is recorded in
[`conformance/divergences.json`](conformance/divergences.json) as the first
entry, with the measurement behind it and what would settle it: a stream table
for a retail cartridge, found by following the game's own code rather than by
searching for a tag.

**One figure has a witness that is not a decoder.** A stream decodes at most
sixty four kilobytes, which is the size of a bank, and the chip decompresses into
one.

**Nothing here is a timing claim.** How long the chip takes, and whether a console
reading the decompressed data can outrun it, is unmodelled and unmeasured.
